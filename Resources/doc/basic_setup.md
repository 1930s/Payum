## Basic setup

### Step 1. Download PayumBundle

Ultimately, the PayumBundle files should be downloaded to the `vendor/payum` directory.

This can be done in several ways, depending on your preference. The method described here is the standard method for Symfony 2.1, using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
If you prefer use git submodule [read this tutorial](install_as_git_submodules.md) and resume to step 2.

Add the following lines in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "payum/payum-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

**Note:** You may want to adapt this line to use a specific version.

Now, run composer.phar to download the bundle:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

**Note:** You can immediately start using it. The autoloading files have been generated by composer and already included to the app autoload file.

### Step 2: Enable the bundle

Finally, enable the bundle in the kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Payum\Bundle\PayumBundle\PayumBundle(),
    );
}
```

### Step 3: Import PayumBundle routing files

Now that you have activated and configured the bundle, all that is left to do is to
import the PayumBundle routing file.

In YAML:

``` yaml
# app/config/routing.yml
payum_capture:
    resource: "@PayumBundle/Resources/config/routing/capture.xml"
```

Or if you prefer XML:

``` xml
<!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
<import resource="@PayumBundle/Resources/config/routing/capture.xml"/>
```

### Next Step

Now you are ready to configure desired payment. Proceed to [index](index.md) and choose payment specific document.
